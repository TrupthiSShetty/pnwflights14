# pnwflights14

This package is a modified version of Hadley Wickham's `nycflights13` package and 
contains information about all flights that departed from the two major airports of
the Pacific Northwest (PNW), SEA in Seattle and PDX in Portland, in 2014: 162,049 
flights in total. To help understand what causes delays, it also includes a number 
of other useful datasets:

* `weather`: hourly meterological data for each airport
* `planes`: construction information about each plane
* `airports`: airport names and locations
* `airlines`: translation between two letter carrier codes and names
